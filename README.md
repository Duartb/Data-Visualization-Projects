**Data Visualization** projects developed during my Data Science Post-Graduation at the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon.

On one the projects, a **PowerBI** dashboard was developed in order to analyse data regarding the Portuguese public school system.

The other project was developed using **ParaView** with the goal of creating visual representations of the evolution of soil regeneration on abondoned fields under multiple scenarios of Global Warming.
